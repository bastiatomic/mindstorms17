### What do we see here?

This project is a java program that uses a Lego Plott3r with LeJos (Java) to print all kinds of images.

### How to use me

To start the application, place an image in the 'graphics' folder and follow the instructions in 'App.java'.

### Motivation behind the project

As part of our teaching at the "University of Applied Science Mittelhessen" we were tasked with creating a java program that can print 'stuff' with a Lego Plott3r. During the brainstorming phase my home printer broke down for the 5th time so I thought: 'why not create a program that can print all kinds of images?' The idea was born.

### Technical settings

The robot itself is a fan-made project (use google for some images) which uses 3 motors (xyz) and 2 sensors to draw with a pencil on a paper. It uses LeJos to send data from a computer to the "brick" on which some kind of Linux (also part of LeJos) is executing the java code.
